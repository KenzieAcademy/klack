# klack
A basic messaging service written with NodeJS+Express, with a web client using the Fetch API.

## Step one
Clone it to your machine.

## Step two
Install the dependencies (Express) by running:

    npm install

## Step three
Find your IP address on the local network. On OS X, you may be able to do this by running:

    ifconfig | grep inet
    
which should yield a line of output like:

    inet 192.168.1.106 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.1.255

OR by opening the network preferences dialog and looking for the message
"Wi-Fi is connected to <NETWORKNAME> and has the IP address **192.168.1.106**."

## Step four
Run the app with the command:

    node app

## Step five
Connect to http://**your.IP.address.here**:3000/ from your web browser AMD from your friends and neighbors browsers!
This is a multiuser messaging app, the more the merrier.
Enter a nickname at the prompt upon loading the page.
